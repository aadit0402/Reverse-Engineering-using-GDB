# Reverse-Engineering-using-GDB

I am following the tutorial.
Here, I am going to play with object file using GDB.
1. I am going to do Malware Analysis with 32 bit architecture.
2. ARM assembly 
3. ARM Reverse Engineering.

There are two basic techniques that can be used during malware analysis. The first one is static and second one is dynamic analysis.

Static analysis uses software tools to examine the exacutable w/o looking at the actual decompiled instructions in Assembly.

But here my focus is on Dynamic analysis, that uses disassemeblers and debuggers to analyze malware binaries. 

Tools: IDA which is multi-platform, multi-processor disassembler and debugger. 

Disassemebler: used to convert an executable binary written in Assembly, C, C++ etc into Assembly Language Instructions, that we can debug and manipulate.
